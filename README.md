### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: Project 1 Final Report
+ This project is conducted by Sam Kolins **(sk3651)**

+ Project summary: In this project, I used the public **HappyDB** database to discuss the following question: ***What makes people happy?*** The database contains over 100,000 "happy moments" from people who work at Amazon Mechanical Turk; the data was collected in spring of 2017. For my project report, please see the appropriately named **Project1_FinalReport_sk3651.html** file (or the **.Rmd** version with the same name, if you wish to take a look at my code). Please also keep in mind the **HappyDB_RShiny.Rmd** file, which contains a Shiny web app that you will need to run if you want to follow along.
