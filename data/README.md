# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Data folder

The **data** directory contains the HappyDB data used in the analysis. This is treated as read-only; in particular, the R/Python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be CSV files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.
